Christen Mooney, a muse, artist and singer-songwriter, has worked with renowned fashion brands and designers including Jean Paul Gaultier, Lotta Volkova, Telfar, Hood By Air, and Anonymous Club. As the creator of ThugPop, Mooney has emerged with a unique, intangible and beautiful style. Our collaboration with ThugPop in 2021 resulted in the creation of the Doll On A Farm filter, an enchanting AR experience that brings his style to life. The filter features a magical farm filled with playful 3D animated objects that interact with each other, earning it worldwide attention and a spot in Instagramâ€™s Weekly Selection on Lenslist.

  Christen Mooney is a muse, artist, creative, fashion model, and singer-songwriter who got emerged with an intangible, beautiful armor in the form of ThugPop. He has been working with the world famous fashion brands and designers as Jean Paul Gaultier, Lotta Volkova, Telfar, Hood By Air, Anonymous Club and more.  He owns every facet of his beauty, and isn’t afraid to revel in it. He gives himself credit for the work he’s put in. He isn’t afraid to speak out against injustice. He calls it like it is. He doesn’t buy-in to shared realities. He knows his history. ThugPop is a force to be reckoned with. An authentic soul that has agreed to share a little knowledge with submission beauty.

Ouhlala is a Paris-based online gallery and boutique that supports artists and designers who offer unique pieces between art and design. The gallery was created by Carole Hours and Frans McCabe. During the 2020 lockdown, our team developed the Ouhlala Foam Mirror filter, an innovative and creative solution to bring the whimsical spirit of Ouhlala into people's homes.

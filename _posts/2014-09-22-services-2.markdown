  Dollchunk is a New York based jewelry brand founded in 2021 by a fashion and beauty writer, editor, and consultant Kristen Bateman whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Vogue US, W Magazine, New York Magazine, V Magazine, Glamour, Harper’s Bazaar, Dazed, i-D magazine, Marie Claire, Glamour, Architectural Digest, Elle, Man Repeller, L’Officiel and more. Dollchunk celebrates the celestialness of being puffy, the bright supernal outlook of all things rotund and happy. In 2022, we partnered with Dollchunk to develop The Doll Parts, an AR try-on filter showcasing their whimsical jewelry collection. Users can virtually try on the Baby Doll and Heart Rings and choose from a variety of makeup options. The goal of the collaboration was to increase social media engagement, and we are proud to have been a part of it.

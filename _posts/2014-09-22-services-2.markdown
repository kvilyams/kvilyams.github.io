  Dollchunk is a NYC-based jewelry brand founded in 2021 by Kristen Bateman, a fashion and beauty writer and editor whose work has appeared in top publications. Our team collaborated with Dollchunk to create The Doll Parts, an AR try-on filter showcasing their whimsical jewelry collection. Users can virtually try on rings and choose from a variety of makeup options.

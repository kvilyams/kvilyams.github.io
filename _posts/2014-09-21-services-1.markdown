  Susan Alexandra is a New York based accessories brand by designer Susan Korn, whose irresistibly kitschy bags and accessories she produces are extremely compelling. They are loved by fashion influencers around the world, and worn by Gigi Hadid, Emma Chamberlain, Pete Davidson and more. She is dedicated to bringing sparkle and joy to everyday life, the world of a glittery, candy colored universe of her own making. Our team partnered with Susan Alexandra to create an Instagram filter for her Butterfly Barrette hair clips. We designed highly-detailed 3D models of the clips and added customizable makeup options, 3D eyelashes, and vibrant hues to allow users to express their creativity. This innovative approach to using the filter as a marketing campaign for her product was one of the first of its kind, reflecting our commitment to creating unique and captivating content that resonates with audiences.
